# 🌱 Fauna Pulse

**Fauna Pulse** is a smart agriculture mobile application built with Flutter. It monitors **soil parameters** (e.g., moisture, temperature, vibration) and uses machine learning models to **predict anomalies** and **alert farmers** when environmental conditions become unfavorable for crops.

This app is part of a precision farming ecosystem, aiming to **increase yield, prevent soil degradation**, and **empower farmers with timely, data-driven insights**.

---

## 📦 Features

* 📡 Real-time soil data acquisition via sensors
* 🔍 Soil condition prediction using a trained ML model
* ⚠️ Alerts via vibration or in-app notifications when thresholds are breached
* 📊 Historical data visualization
* 🔭 Offline data sync support (optional)
* 🔐 Modular and scalable architecture using clean code principles

---

## 💪 Tech Stack

* **Flutter** (Dart)
* **State Management**: [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev) *(recommended)* or [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get)
* **Routing**: [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)
* **HTTP Client**: [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)
* **Persistence**: Hive / SharedPreferences
* **Code Generation**: Freezed, JsonSerializable
* **Visualization**: syncfusion\_flutter\_charts or fl\_chart

├── config/             # App configuration files and environment settings
├── models/             # Data models, entities, and business logic
├── screens/            # UI screens and widgets
└── main.dart           # Application entry point
```

## 🧪 Useful Dev Commands

* Format code:

  ```bash
  dart format .
  ```

* Generate freezed/json files:

  ```bash
  flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```

* Analyze project:

  ```bash
  flutter analyze
  ```

## 📦 State Management

This project uses [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev) for managing app state:

```dart
final soilMoistureProvider = StateProvider<double>((ref) => 0.0);
```

Alternatively, GetX can be configured if preferred.

---

## 🧠 Prediction Engine

Soil data (moisture, temperature, etc.) is passed to a trained machine learning model, which returns one of the following:

* ✅ **Optimum**: Soil conditions are optimal.
* ⚠️ **High**: Parameters nearing harmful thresholds.
* ❌ **Low**: Immediate action required.

Results are used to **trigger device vibrations** or notify the farmer via the app UI.
