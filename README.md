Here’s a cleaned-up and professional version of your **README.md** file for your **FaunaPulse** project:

# 🌱 FaunaPulse

## 📌 Project Description

**FaunaPulse** is an AI- and IoT-powered system designed to **non-invasively monitor the biological activity of underground soil organisms** in real time using bioacoustic signals and environmental data. The system empowers farmers to remotely assess soil vitality, detect anomalies in soil ecosystems, and support sustainable agricultural practices.

At its core, **piezoelectric discs** detect subtle vibrations generated by soil-dwelling organisms. A trained **deep learning model** then classifies these acoustic signals into activity levels:

* **High**: Indicates diverse and active fauna
* **Low**: Suggests sparse or absent soil life

Simultaneously, the system gathers essential environmental metrics via sensors:

* **DS18B20** – Soil Temperature
* **SEN0193** – Soil Moisture
* **SHT31-D** – Humidity

All data is securely transmitted to a cloud backend (e.g., **Supabase** or **Firebase**) and displayed in a **user-friendly mobile app**. When critical conditions are detected (e.g., low fauna activity, poor moisture), **real-time alerts** are triggered via email and in-app notifications. FaunaPulse enables proactive soil health management and ecological sustainability.
