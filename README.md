# 🌱 FaunaPulse - AI-Driven IoT system for non-invasive soil fauna monitoring via bioacoustic and environmental sensing.

## 📌 Project Description

**FaunaPulse** is an AI- and IoT-powered system designed to **non-invasively monitor the biological activity of underground soil organisms** in real time using bioacoustic signals and environmental data. The system empowers farmers to remotely assess soil vitality, detect anomalies in soil ecosystems, and support sustainable agricultural practices.

At its core, **piezoelectric discs** detect subtle vibrations generated by soil-dwelling organisms. A trained **deep learning model** then classifies these acoustic signals into activity levels:

* **High**: Indicates diverse and active fauna
* **Low**: Suggests sparse or absent soil life

Simultaneously, the system gathers essential environmental metrics via sensors:

* **SHT30 Sensor Probe** – Soil Temperature and Humidity
* **Capacitive Analog Sensor** – Soil Moisture

All data is securely transmitted to a cloud backend (e.g., **Supabase** or **Firebase**) and displayed in a **user-friendly mobile app**. When critical conditions are detected (e.g., low fauna activity, poor moisture), **real-time alerts** are triggered via email and in-app notifications. FaunaPulse enables proactive soil health management and ecological sustainability.

## 🚀 Deployment Plan

The **FaunaPulse** system is designed to be fully operational in real-world agricultural environments. The deployment architecture includes several integrated components: a deep learning model, a FastAPI backend, a mobile frontend, and sensor hardware. Here's how each piece is deployed:

---

### 1. 🧠 Model Deployment (Hugging Face)

- The trained deep learning model, responsible for classifying bioacoustic data (high vs low fauna activity), will be hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**.
- This ensures scalability, version control, and easy integration with the FastAPI backend via API calls.
- Continuous monitoring and retraining of the model can be managed via Hugging Face's CI/CD tools or GitHub Actions.

<!-- 🔗 [View or access the model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/...) -->

---

### 2. ⚙️ Backend Deployment (FastAPI + Render)

- The backend server is built using **FastAPI** and deployed on **Render**, a reliable and cost-effective platform for web services.
- The backend handles:
  - Receiving and processing sensor/audio data.
  - Forwarding audio to the ML model API.
  - Managing user authentication and alert logic.
  - Interfacing with the Supabase/Firebase database.

🔗 The live API URL can be found in the [API directory README](https://github.com/SammyGbabs/FaunaPulse-Capstone-Project/tree/main/API).

---

### 3. 📱 Mobile App Deployment (Flutter)

- The mobile app is developed in **Flutter**, ensuring cross-platform compatibility (Android).
- Features include:
  - Real-time dashboard.
  - Chatbot support.
  - History logs.
  - Manual data uploads.
  - Push notifications and alerts.
- The APK is available for direct download or can be built via:

### 4. 📡 Hardware Deployment (IoT + Sensor Network)

* Sensors used:

  * **Piezo Discs** – for capturing soil vibrations.
  * **SHT30** – for soil temperature and humidty.
  * **Capacitive analog** – for soil moisture.
* Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32-C3) reads sensor values and transmits data via Wi-Fi to the FastAPI endpoint.
* Power: Battery-operated setup for remote farms.
* Hardware is enclosed in weather-resistant casing for durability in field conditions.

---

### 5. 🔒 Database & Authentication (Supabase or Firebase)

* **Supabase** (or **Firebase** as an alternative) is used to:

  * Store sensor data, user records, and historical logs.
  * Manage user sessions and secure authentication.
  * Provide real-time syncing for dynamic data updates.

---

### 6. 🔔 Notification System

* The system leverages:

  * **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for in-app push notifications.
  * **SendGrid** or **SMTP** for automated email alerts.
* Notifications are triggered when:

  * Fauna activity drops below expected thresholds.
  * Soil moisture/temperature/humidity exceeds healthy ranges.
